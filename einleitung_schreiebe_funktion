Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

pyserial for serial communication.
The Adafruit PN532 library.
You can install pyserial using:

bash
Copy code
sudo pip3 install pyserial
If you haven't installed the Adafruit PN532 library yet, you can do so by cloning the repository and installing it:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PN532.git
cd Adafruit_CircuitPython_PN532
sudo python3 setup.py install
Wiring the PN532 to Raspberry Pi (UART Mode): Make sure your PN532 is connected to the Raspberry Pi as follows:

| PN532 Pin | Raspberry Pi Pin | |-----------|------------------| | VCC | 3.3V | | GND | Ground | | TX | GPIO 15 (RXD) | | RX | GPIO 14 (TXD) |

Create a new Python file (e.g., write_nfc.py):

bash
Copy code
nano write_nfc.py
Copy and paste the following code into the file:

python
Copy code
import time
import serial
from adafruit_pn532.pn532 import PN532

# Initialize serial connection
uart = serial.Serial("/dev/serial0", baudrate=115200, timeout=1)

# Create PN532 instance
pn532 = PN532(uart)

# Initialize the PN532
pn532.SAM_configuration()

print("Waiting for an NFC card...")

while True:
    # Check for an NFC card
    uid = pn532.read_passive_target()
    
    if uid is not None:
        print("Found an NFC card!")
        print("UID:", [hex(i) for i in uid])
        
        # Write data to the NFC tag
        try:
            # The data you want to write
            data_to_write = "Hello, NFC!"
            print("Writing data to the NFC tag...")
            pn532.ntag2xx_WriteNDEF(data_to_write.encode('utf-8'))
            print("Data written successfully!")
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error writing to NFC tag:", e)
        
        time.sleep(1)  # Wait a bit before looking for another card
